1. print only duplicate elements.
2. Input: "Hello There"
    Output: "olleH erehT"
3.  JUnit related questions:-
a. Annotation Interface DataJpaTest

	Annotation for a JPA test that focuses only on JPA components.
	Using this annotation will disable full auto-configuration and instead apply only configuration relevant to JPA tests.

	By default, tests annotated with @DataJpaTest are transactional and roll back at the end of each test. They also use an embedded in-memory database (replacing any explicit or usually auto-configured DataSource). The @AutoConfigureTestDatabase annotation can be used to override these settings.

	SQL queries are logged by default by setting the spring.jpa.show-sql property to true. This can be disabled using the showSql attribute.

	If you are looking to load your full application configuration, but use an embedded database, you should consider @SpringBootTest combined with @AutoConfigureTestDatabase rather than this annotation.

	When using JUnit 4, this annotation should be used in combination with @RunWith(SpringRunner.class).

b. ExtendWith is used for?
	@ExtendWith(SpringExtension. class) â€” @ExtendWith annotation is used to register extensions for JUnit5 test, SpringExtension. class allows the test to load the Spring context and inject dependencies into the test class.
	
c. Difference between @mocks and @InjectMocks

	The @Mock annotation is used to create a mock object for a particular class, while the @InjectMocks annotation is used to inject the mock object into the class being tested.

It is important to note that @InjectMocks can only be used with classes, not with interfaces.
